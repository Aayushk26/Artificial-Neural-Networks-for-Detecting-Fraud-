# Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-Detecting-Fruad
This is a simple ANN with some techniques such as dropout regularisation to predict fraud using bank details
- Data is taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(australian+credit+approval)
- Bank data of 690 users was taken 
- test size is 20 % 
- accuracy of the model is 89.13%
- tensorflow
- keras
- Dropout regularisation was used to improve the model.
- If you have suggestions to improve the model please share. It would be of great help . tnaks :) Peace.
